### Architectural Patterns

**Microservices Architecture:** A design that structures an application as a collection of small, independent services. Each service is self-contained, runs its own process, and communicates with others using lightweight APIs. This pattern is ideal for large, complex applications that require high scalability and independent deployment.

**Serverless Architecture:** A method of providing backend services where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure. Developers can run code (functions) in response to events without provisioning or managing servers. This approach is highly scalable, cost-effective, and reduces operational overhead.

**Event-Driven Architecture:** A software design pattern where services communicate by producing and consuming asynchronous events. This decouples the services and makes the system more resilient and scalable. It is commonly used for real-time data processing and complex workflows.

### Cloud Services

**AWS Lambda:** A serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. It's highly scalable and is triggered by events.

**AWS S3:** A simple object storage service. It provides highly durable and scalable storage that can be used to store application data, backups, and media files.

**AWS RDS:** Amazon Relational Database Service. A managed database service that simplifies the setup, operation, and scaling of a relational database. It is suitable for traditional, structured data.

**AWS DynamoDB:** A managed NoSQL database service. It provides high-performance and scalable key-value and document data storage, ideal for applications with high-traffic, real-time needs.

**Azure Functions:** A serverless compute service that enables you to run event-triggered code in the cloud without managing infrastructure.

### Best Practices

**Scalability:** To handle high traffic, use managed services like AWS Lambda or Azure Functions. For databases, consider NoSQL options like DynamoDB for high throughput.

**Security:** Use Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage user permissions and access to resources. Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit.

**Cost Optimization:** Favor serverless solutions for unpredictable workloads. For consistent traffic, consider using reserved instances on EC2 to reduce costs over time.
