## Mission: Intelligent Solution Architecture

Welcome to the official repository for Team Bulbasaur's project in the Infostatus AI Coding Olympics. Our mission is to build a cutting-edge AI agent system that can design comprehensive technical solutions and generate detailed architectural proposals.

Our system aims to automate the complex process of technical solution design, enabling us to rapidly create technically sound, detailed, and visually compelling architectural blueprints for a wide range of client requirements.

## Challenge 1: Foundation Building (September 8-14)

This week, we are focused on building the foundational AI agents that will form the core of our solution.

* **Objective**: To develop a modular and reusable toolkit of AI agents.
* **Key Components**:
    * **The Knowledge Agent üß†**: Our central intelligence unit, powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This agent will ingest technical documentation, architectural patterns, and cloud service data to inform its solution designs.
    * **The Diagram Agent üé®**: A core innovation, this agent will automatically generate clear, professional technical diagrams from the output of our Knowledge Agent using a "Diagram as Code" approach.
